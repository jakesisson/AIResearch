# Start the bot
uv run python -m boss_bot
```

### Key Configuration Files

#### 1. Package Management (pyproject.toml)
```toml
[project]
name = "boss-bot"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
    "discord-py>=2.5.2",
    "gallery-dl>=1.29.3",
    "loguru>=0.7.3",
    "pydantic-settings>=2.8.1",
    # ... other dependencies
]
```

#### 2. Code Quality Tools
- **Ruff**: Primary linter and formatter
  ```yaml
  # .pre-commit-config.yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
        args: [--fix, --exit-non-zero-on-fix]
      - id: ruff-format
  ```

#### 3. Testing Framework
- pytest with extensions:
  - pytest-asyncio for async testing
  - pytest-recording for HTTP mocking
  - pytest-cov for coverage reporting
  - pytest-retry for flaky tests
  - pytest-skipuntil for handling flaky Discord API tests

#### Test Organization
```text
tests/
├── conftest.py              # Shared test configuration and fixtures
├── fixtures/               # Test data and mock responses
│   ├── tweet_data.py      # Twitter API mock responses
│   ├── reddit_data.py     # Reddit API mock responses
│   ├── discord_data.py    # Discord API mock responses
│   └── cassettes/         # VCR cassettes for HTTP mocking

├── integration/          # Integration tests
└── eval/                # Future RAG evaluation tests
```

#### Handling Flaky Tests
- Use pytest-skipuntil for Discord API tests that may be unreliable
- Store HTTP interactions in VCR cassettes under tests/fixtures/cassettes/
- Use dpytest for reliable Discord command testing
- Example:
  ```python
  @pytest.mark.skipuntil("2024-06-01")  # Skip until Discord API is stable
  async def test_discord_feature():
      # Test implementation
  ```

#### Test Fixtures
- Add new fixtures in tests/fixtures/
- Use VCR for HTTP mocking:
  ```python
  @pytest.fixture(scope="module")
  def vcr_config():
      """VCR configuration for HTTP mocking."""
      return {
          "filter_headers": ["authorization"],
          "filter_post_data_parameters": ["token", "api_key"]
      }
  ```

#### 4. Documentation
- MkDocs with extensions:
  ```yaml
  # mkdocs.yml configuration
  plugins:
    - mkdocstrings
    - coverage
    - git-revision-date-localized
    - macros
  ```

### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch
2. Write tests first (TDD)
3. Implement feature
4. Run pre-commit hooks
5. Submit PR

### CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Actions workflow includes:
- Linting with Ruff
- Testing with pytest
- Documentation generation
- Coverage reporting

### Environment Variables

```

## Goals

- Create a reliable and efficient Discord bot for media downloads with >99% uptime
- Implement MVP test coverage targets:
  * Core Download: 30%
  * Command Parsing: 25%
  * Discord Events: 20% (limited by dpytest capabilities)
  * File Management: 20%
- Ensure all modules follow clean code practices and stay under 120 lines
- Build a foundation for future RAG capabilities
- Provide clear progress tracking and queue management for downloads
- Maintain clear documentation and type hints for junior developer onboarding

## Test-Driven Development Guidelines

### Core Principles
1. Write failing test first
2. Keep tests focused and small
3. Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior
4. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
5. No implementation without a failing test

### Example Test Patterns

#### Command Testing
```python
async def test_download_command_validates_url():
    """Test that download command properly validates URLs."""
    # Arrange
    bot = await create_test_bot()
    invalid_url = "not-a-url"

    # Act
    await send_command(bot, f"$dlt {invalid_url}")

    # Assert
    assert_bot_replied_with(bot, "Invalid URL")

async def test_download_command_handles_valid_url():
    """Test that download command processes valid URLs."""
    # Arrange
    bot = await create_test_bot()
    valid_url = "https://twitter.com/user/status/123"

    # Act
    await send_command(bot, f"$dlt {valid_url}")

    # Assert
    assert_download_started(bot, valid_url)
```

#### Event Testing
```python
async def test_bot_handles_disconnect():
    """Test that bot properly handles disconnection events."""
    # Arrange
    bot = await create_test_bot()
    await ensure_bot_connected(bot)

    # Act
    await simulate_disconnect(bot)

    # Assert
    assert_reconnection_attempted(bot)
    assert_event_logged(bot, "disconnect")
```

### Best Practices
1. **Test Isolation**
   - Each test should be independent
   - Clean up resources after each test
   - Use fresh fixtures for each test

2. **Meaningful Names**
   - Test names should describe behavior
   - Use consistent naming patterns
   - Include success and failure cases

3. **Test Organization**
   - Group related tests in classes
   - Use descriptive test class names
   - Keep test files focused and small

4. **Mocking and Fixtures**
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Use fixtures for common setup
   - Keep mocks simple and focused

from prometheus_client import Counter, Gauge, Histogram

# Core Download Metrics
DOWNLOAD_REQUESTS = Counter(
    'download_requests_total',
    'Total download requests',
    ['platform', 'status']  # platform: twitter/reddit, status: success/failed
)

DOWNLOAD_DURATION = Histogram(
    'download_duration_seconds',
    'Time spent downloading',
    ['platform'],
    buckets=[1, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 300]  # 1s to 5min buckets
)

QUEUE_SIZE = Gauge(
    'download_queue_size',
    'Current size of download queue'
)

# Performance Metrics
COMMAND_LATENCY = Histogram(
    'command_latency_seconds',
    'Command processing time',
    ['command'],
    buckets=[0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5]  # 100ms to 5s buckets
)

DISCORD_API_LATENCY = Gauge(
    'discord_api_latency_seconds',
    'Discord API latency'
)

# Error Metrics
ERROR_COUNT = Counter(
    'error_total',
    'Total errors by type',
    ['error_type', 'platform']
)

    'download_file_size_bytes',
    'Size of downloaded files',
    ['platform'],
    buckets=[1024*1024*x for x in [1, 5, 10, 25, 50]]  # 1MB to 50MB buckets
)

TEMP_FILES = Gauge(
    'temp_files_count',
    'Number of files in temporary storage'
)
```

These metrics provide comprehensive monitoring of:

## File Management Specifications

### Storage Architecture

#### Directory Structure
```text
/tmp/boss-bot/
├── downloads/
│   ├── {guild_id}/
│   │   ├── {yyyy-mm-dd}/
│   │   │   ├── {download_id}/
│   │   │   │   ├── metadata.json
│   │   │   │   └── content/
│   │   │   │       └── {filename}
│   │   │   └── .cleanup
│   │   └── .stats
│   └── .maintenance
├── temp/
│   └── {download_id}/
└── .locks/
```

### Storage Policies

#### Temporary Storage
- **Location**: All downloads initially go to `/tmp/boss-bot/temp/{download_id}/`
- **Retention**: Files in temp are deleted after:
  * Successful upload to Discord (immediate)
  * Failed download (30 minutes)
  * Abandoned download (1 hour)
- **Size Limits**:
  * Individual file: 50MB (Discord limit)
  * Total temp storage: 1GB
  * Per guild daily quota: 500MB

#### Organized Storage
- **Structure**: Downloads are organized by guild and date
- **Metadata**: Each download includes a metadata.json file containing:
  * Original URL
  * Download timestamp
  * User information
  * File checksums
  * Processing history
- **Retention Periods**:
  * Successful downloads: 24 hours
  * Failed downloads with retry potential: 6 hours
  * Premium guild downloads: 72 hours

### Cleanup Mechanisms

#### Scheduled Cleanup
```python
class CleanupSchedule:
    """Cleanup schedule configuration."""
    TEMP_SCAN_INTERVAL: int = 300  # 5 minutes
    MAIN_SCAN_INTERVAL: int = 3600  # 1 hour
    DEEP_SCAN_INTERVAL: int = 86400  # 24 hours
```

#### Cleanup Rules
1. **Temporary Files**:
   - Run every 5 minutes
   - Remove files older than their retention period
   - Remove files from completed/failed downloads
   - Clean partial downloads older than 1 hour

2. **Main Storage**:
   - Run every hour
   - Remove expired files based on retention policy
   - Clean empty directories
   - Update storage statistics

3. **Deep Cleanup**:
   - Run daily during low-usage hours
   - Perform integrity checks
   - Remove orphaned files
   - Compress and archive logs
   - Generate storage reports

### File Operations

#### Download Process
1. **Initial Download**:
   ```python
   async def download_flow(url: str, guild_id: int) -> Path:
       temp_path = get_temp_path(download_id)
       try:
           await download_to_temp(url, temp_path)
           await validate_download(temp_path)
           final_path = organize_download(temp_path, guild_id)
           return final_path
       except Exception as e:
           await cleanup_failed_download(temp_path)
           raise
   ```

2. **Validation Checks**:
   - File size limits
   - MIME type verification
   - Malware scanning
   - File integrity checks

3. **Organization Process**:
   - Create guild/date directories
   - Generate metadata
   - Move from temp to organized storage
   - Update storage statistics

### Error Handling

#### Storage Errors
```python
class StorageError(Enum):
    DISK_FULL = "Insufficient disk space"
    QUOTA_EXCEEDED = "Guild quota exceeded"
    INVALID_FILE = "File validation failed"
    CLEANUP_ERROR = "Cleanup process failed"
```

#### Recovery Procedures
1. **Disk Space Issues**:
   - Trigger emergency cleanup
   - Notify administrators
   - Temporarily reject new downloads

2. **Quota Exceeded**:
   - Notify guild administrators
   - Provide cleanup recommendations
   - Offer premium upgrade options

3. **Validation Failures**:
   - Log detailed error information
   - Notify user with specific reason
   - Clean up invalid files immediately

### Monitoring and Metrics

#### Storage Metrics
```python
class StorageMetrics(BaseModel):
    """Storage monitoring metrics."""
    total_space_used: int
    temp_space_used: int
    downloads_per_guild: Dict[int, int]
    cleanup_stats: CleanupStats
    error_counts: Dict[StorageError, int]
```

#### Alerts
- Disk space usage > 80%
- Cleanup job failures
- High error rates
- Quota approaching limits
- Suspicious file patterns

### File Types and Processing

#### Supported File Types
```python
class SupportedTypes(BaseModel):
    """Supported file types and their processors."""
    IMAGES: List[str] = ["jpg", "png", "gif", "webp"]
    VIDEOS: List[str] = ["mp4", "webm", "mov"]
    AUDIO: List[str] = ["mp3", "wav", "ogg"]
    MAX_SIZES: Dict[str, int] = {
        "image": 5_242_880,  # 5MB
        "video": 52_428_800,  # 50MB
        "audio": 10_485_760  # 10MB
    }
```

#### Processing Rules
1. **Images**:
   - Convert to Discord-optimal formats
   - Resize if exceeding limits
   - Strip metadata

2. **Videos**:
   - Transcode to Discord-compatible format
   - Adjust bitrate if needed
   - Generate thumbnail

3. **Audio**:
   - Convert to Discord-supported format
   - Adjust quality if size exceeds limits

This comprehensive file management system ensures:
- Efficient use of storage space
- Reliable cleanup of temporary files
- Clear organization of downloads
- Robust error handling
- Detailed monitoring and metrics
- Type-safe file processing

        Default priority: Normal
        Total downloads today: 5/10
   ```

### Notification System

#### Update Types
```python
class NotificationPreference(Enum):
    """User notification preferences."""
    NONE = "none"  # No updates
    MINIMAL = "minimal"  # Start/finish only
    NORMAL = "normal"  # Regular progress
    VERBOSE = "verbose"  # Detailed updates
```

#### Notification Rules
1. **Queue Position Updates**:
   - When moving up in queue
   - When about to start
   - On significant delays

2. **Download Progress**:
   - Start of download
   - Regular progress updates
   - Completion/failure
   - Processing status

3. **Error Notifications**:
   - Clear error description
   - Recommended actions
   - Retry instructions
   - Support information

### User Settings

```python
class UserPreferences(BaseModel):
    """User-configurable settings."""
    notification_level: NotificationPreference
    progress_bar_style: str
    default_priority: DownloadPriority
    mention_on_complete: bool
    auto_retry: bool
    max_retries: int = 3
```

#### Default Values
```python
DEFAULT_PREFERENCES = UserPreferences(
    notification_level=NotificationPreference.NORMAL,
    progress_bar_style="standard",
    default_priority=DownloadPriority.NORMAL,
    mention_on_complete=True,
    auto_retry=True
)
```

class HelpFormat:
    """Help message formatting."""
    TEMPLATE: str = """
    {command}: {description}
    Usage: {usage}
    Examples:
    {examples}
    Notes:
    {notes}
    """
```

Example Help Message:
```
$dlt: Download from Twitter
Usage: $dlt <url> [priority]

Examples:
  $dlt https://twitter.com/user/status/123
  $dlt https://twitter.com/user/status/123 high

Notes:
- Supports single tweets and threads
- Max file size: 50MB
- Supported formats: Images, Videos
```

### Error Messages

#### User-Friendly Errors
```python
class ErrorMessages:
    """User-friendly error messages."""
    TEMPLATES = {
        ErrorType.NETWORK: (
            "🔌 Connection issue! I couldn't reach {platform}.\n"
            "I'll retry {retry_count} more times.\n"
            "Try again in {retry_after} seconds."
        ),
        ErrorType.RATE_LIMIT: (
            "⏳ We're being rate limited by {platform}.\n"
            "Please wait {retry_after} seconds."
        ),
        ErrorType.FILE_TOO_LARGE: (
            "📦 File is too large ({size}MB)!\n"
            "Maximum size: {max_size}MB\n"
            "Try requesting a smaller version."
        )
    }
```

The user experience design focuses on:
- Clear and intuitive commands
- Real-time progress feedback
- Interactive controls
- Customizable notifications
- Helpful error messages
- Comprehensive help system

Would you like me to:
1. Add more command examples?
2. Expand the notification system?
3. Add more interactive features?
4. Detail the help system further?

<test_strategy>
## Test-Driven Development Strategy

### 1. Core Test Infrastructure

#### Test Fixtures
```python
@pytest.fixture
async def test_bot():
    """Core bot fixture for Discord command testing."""
    intents = discord.Intents.default()
    intents.message_content = True
    bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="$", intents=intents)
    await bot._async_setup_hook()
    dpytest.configure(bot)
    yield bot
    await dpytest.empty_queue()

@pytest.fixture
def mock_downloader():
    """Mock downloader for testing download functionality."""
    with patch('bot.download.Downloader') as mock:
        yield mock
```

### 2. Command Testing Strategy

#### Download Command Tests
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
class TestDownloadCommands:
    async def test_valid_twitter_url(self, test_bot, mock_downloader):
        url = "https://twitter.com/user/status/123"
        await dpytest.message(f"$dlt {url}")
        assert dpytest.verify().message().contains()
        mock_downloader.download.assert_called_once_with(url)

    async def test_invalid_url(self, test_bot):
        url = "not_a_url"
        await dpytest.message(f"$dlt {url}")
        assert dpytest.verify().message().contains("Invalid URL")

    async def test_queue_full(self, test_bot, mock_downloader):
        mock_downloader.queue_size.return_value = 50
        url = "https://twitter.com/user/status/123"
        await dpytest.message(f"$dlt {url}")
        assert dpytest.verify().message().contains("Queue full")
```

### 3. Integration Testing

```python
@pytest.mark.integration
class TestDownloadFlow:
    async def test_download_to_completion(self, test_bot, mock_downloader):
        # Given
        url = "https://twitter.com/user/status/123"
        mock_downloader.download.return_value = "file.mp4"

        # When
        await dpytest.message(f"$dlt {url}")

        # Then
        assert dpytest.verify().message().contains("Started")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        assert dpytest.verify().message().contains("Complete")
        assert os.path.exists("file.mp4")
```

### 4. Error Case Testing

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
class TestErrorHandling:
    async def test_network_failure(self, test_bot, mock_downloader):
        mock_downloader.download.side_effect = NetworkError
        url = "https://twitter.com/user/status/123"
        await dpytest.message(f"$dlt {url}")
        assert dpytest.verify().message().contains("Network error")

    async def test_rate_limit(self, test_bot, mock_downloader):
        mock_downloader.download.side_effect = RateLimitError
        url = "https://twitter.com/user/status/123"
        await dpytest.message(f"$dlt {url}")
        assert dpytest.verify().message().contains("Rate limited")
```

### 5. Performance Testing

```python
@pytest.mark.performance
class TestPerformance:
    async def test_response_time(self, test_bot):
        start = time.time()
        await dpytest.message("$dlt url")
        response_time = time.time() - start
        assert response_time < 1.0

    async def test_concurrent_downloads(self, test_bot):
        urls = [f"url{i}" for i in range(10)]
        tasks = [dpytest.message(f"$dlt {url}") for url in urls]
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        assert mock_downloader.active_downloads <= 5
```

### 6. Test Coverage Requirements

        "match_on": ["method", "scheme", "host", "port", "path", "query"]
    }
```

#### Coverage Requirements (MVP)
| Component          | Target Coverage |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Core Download     | 30%            |
| Command Parsing   | 25%            |

Note: These are minimum targets for MVP. Higher coverage will be required for critical paths.
</test_strategy>

<technical_implementation>
## Technical Implementation Details

### Error Handling (MVP)

#### Core Error Types
```python
class BotErrorType(str, Enum):
    """Core error types for MVP."""
    DOWNLOAD_FAILED = "download_failed"
    INVALID_URL = "invalid_url"
    QUEUE_FULL = "queue_full"
    FILE_TOO_LARGE = "file_too_large"
    DISCORD_ERROR = "discord_error"
```

### Logging Configuration

The application uses Loguru for structured logging with the following configuration:

```python
import sys
from loguru import logger

# Remove default handler
logger.remove()

# Configure Loguru
logger.configure(
    handlers=[
        {
            "sink": sys.stdout,
            "format": "<green>{time:YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.SSS}</green> | <level>{level: <8}</level> | <cyan>{name}</cyan>:<cyan>{function}</cyan>:<cyan>{line}</cyan> - <level>{message}</level>",
            "level": "INFO",
            "colorize": True,
            "backtrace": True,
            "diagnose": True,
            "enqueue": True,
        }
    ]
)

# Add better exception handling
logger.add(
    sys.stderr,
    format="{time} | {level} | {message}",
    filter=lambda record: record["level"].name == "ERROR",
    level="ERROR",
    backtrace=True,
    diagnose=True,
)

# Example logging usage
logger.info("Bot starting up...")
logger.debug("Processing download request: {url}", url="https://example.com")
logger.warning("Rate limit approaching: {limit}", limit=10)
logger.error("Download failed: {error}", error="Network timeout")
```

#### Log Levels
- DEBUG: Detailed information for debugging
- INFO: General operational events
- WARNING: Unexpected but handled situations
- ERROR: Errors that need attention
- CRITICAL: System-level failures

#### Logging Guidelines
1. Use structured logging with context:
   ```python
   logger.info("Download started", url=url, user_id=user_id)
   ```

2. Include relevant context in errors:
   ```python
   try:
       await download_file(url)
   except Exception as e:
       logger.exception(f"Download failed: {str(e)}", url=url)
   ```

3. Use appropriate log levels:
   - DEBUG: Detailed flow information
   - INFO: Normal operations
   - WARNING: Potential issues
   - ERROR: Operation failures
   - CRITICAL: System failures

4. Log sensitive information appropriately:
   ```python
   logger.info(
