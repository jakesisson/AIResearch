Current workflow context:

User's message: "{user_message}"

Analyze the user's intent and respond with ONLY a JSON object containing:
- action: One of ["classify", "prescribe", "show_vendors", "attention_overlay", "restart", "complete", "direct_response"]
- response: (string) If action is "direct_response", provide a helpful answer to their question. Otherwise, leave empty.
- overlay_type: (string) If action is "attention_overlay", specify "show_overlay" or "overlay_info". Otherwise, leave empty.
- confidence: (number 0-1) How confident you are in this classification.

Action meanings:
- "classify": User wants disease diagnosis/classification
- "prescribe": User wants treatment recommendations, dosage info, application instructions  
- "show_vendors": User wants to find/buy products or vendors
- "attention_overlay": User wants to see diagnostic attention overlay/heatmap
- "restart": User wants to start over with new diagnosis
- "complete": User is done/saying goodbye
- "direct_response": Answer their question directly (for general agriculture questions, clarifications, etc.)

Guidelines:
1. If they ask about dosage, application, treatment instructions - use "prescribe" if no prescription exists, otherwise "direct_response" with detailed answer using available prescription data
2. If they ask general agriculture questions (soil, weather, growing tips) - use "direct_response"  
3. If they're asking for clarification about previous results - use "direct_response"
4. Be flexible with natural language - "yes give me dosage" means they want prescription/dosage info
5. Consider context - if they have prescription data and ask about dosage, provide direct_response with that info
