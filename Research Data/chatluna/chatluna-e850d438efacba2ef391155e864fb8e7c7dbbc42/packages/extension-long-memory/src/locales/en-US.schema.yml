                      - Basic (Basic Engine) - A simple text-based memory engine that adds all memories to the context.
                      - HippoRAG (HippoRAG Engine) - A long-term memory engine based on HippoRAG.
                      - EMGAS (EMGAS Engine) - A long-term memory engine based on EMGAS.

      longMemoryExtractModel: Model for automatic long-term memory analysis and extraction.
      longMemoryQueryRewrite: Whether to enable query rewrite (model generates more appropriate queries before searching long-term memory).
      longMemoryExtractInterval: Automatic memory extraction interval in turns (perform memory extraction every N rounds of conversation).
    - $desc: HippoRAG Long-term Memory Settings
      hippoSimilarityThreshold: Final hybrid score threshold (0~1; higher = stricter).
      hippoPPRAlpha: PPR random walk parameter alpha (0~1, default 0.15).
      hippoTopEntities: Number of top-scored entities selected by PPR (for candidate expansion).
      hippoMaxCandidates: Maximum candidate memories generated by PPR.
      hippoHybridWeight: Hybrid re-ranking weight (proportion of human score; remainder for PPR score). 0.8 biases toward semantic and fingerprint robustness.
      hippoIEEnabled: Whether to enable triple extraction (build relation edges to strengthen the knowledge graph).
      hippoBridgeThreshold: Entity bridging threshold (character Shingle Jaccard; automatically add edges between similar entities).
      hippoReinforceTopK: Only reinforce top K hits with "usage reinforcement" (reduce write amplification).
      hippoAliasThreshold: Entity alias merging threshold (character Shingle Jaccard; entities with similarity ≥ threshold are merged as the same entity).
      hippoKGPersist: Whether to persist knowledge graph to disk (no need to rebuild after restart).
      hippoExtractModel: Model used for memory extraction/query rewrite (choosing faster models can improve throughput).
    - $desc: EMGAS Long-term Memory Settings
      emgasExtractModel: Model used for concept and topic extraction from memory content.
      emgasDecayRate: Temporal decay Lambda (λ) - Controls the rate of background forgetting for memories (0.001~0.1). Higher values cause faster memory decay, affecting nodes' baseline activation values and indirectly influencing their potential to be activated during retrieval.
      emgasPruneThreshold: Pruning threshold for low-activation nodes (0.01~0.5). Nodes with activation below this threshold will be removed from the memory graph to maintain graph cleanliness and retrieval efficiency.
      emgasFiringThreshold: Firing threshold (F) - Minimum activation level required for a node to propagate its energy (0.0~1.0). Higher values lead to more focused, less exploratory searches; lower values allow broader, more distant associations.
      emgasPropagationDecay: Propagation decay (D) - Proportion of energy lost in each hop of propagation (0.0~1.0). Higher decay values (closer to 1.0) restrict search to seed node neighbors; lower decay values (closer to 0.0) allow activation to spread to more distant nodes.
      emgasMaxIterations: Maximum iterations - Hard limit to force termination of the diffusion process (3~10). Directly controls retrieval latency. Fewer iterations return more direct associations, while more iterations discover deeper indirect associations.
      emgasTopN: Maximum number of candidate memories to retrieve from the graph (5~100). Controls the quantity of returned results, balancing memory coverage and processing efficiency.
