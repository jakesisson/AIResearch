# HippoRAG TypeScript Implementation

This directory contains a TypeScript/JavaScript port of the HippoRAG (Hippocampus-inspired RAG) system, originally developed by the OSU NLP Group.

## Acknowledgments

We extend our sincere gratitude to the original authors and contributors of the HippoRAG project for their groundbreaking work in retrieval-augmented generation systems. This implementation is based on their innovative research and open-source contributions.

**Original Project**: [HippoRAG](https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG)
**Original Authors**: OSU NLP Group

## About This Implementation

The files in this directory have been converted from the original Python implementation to TypeScript to integrate with our Node.js-based system. The core algorithms, prompt templates, and functionality remain faithful to the original design while being adapted for the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem.

### Key Components

- **Prompt Templates**: Converted prompt templates for various RAG scenarios
- **Core Logic**: TypeScript implementations of HippoRAG algorithms
- **Integration**: Adapted for use with LangChain and our vector store service
