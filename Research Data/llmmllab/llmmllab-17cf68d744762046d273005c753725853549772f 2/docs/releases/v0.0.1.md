# LLM ML Lab v0.0.1 Release Notes

## 🚀 Major Improvements

### Web Extraction Service Simplification
- **Eliminated complex Scrapy-based architecture** in favor of simple HTTP requests
- **Removed separate files**: `simple_web_extractor.py` and `web_extraction_patch.py`
- **Integrated extraction logic** directly into `WebExtractionService` class
- **Improved maintainability** with straightforward requests + BeautifulSoup approach

### Technical Improvements
- Direct `requests.Session` with retry strategies and browser-like headers
- `BeautifulSoup` parsing with intelligent content selectors  
- Optional `user_config` parameter with proper null handling
- Reduced code complexity by ~200 lines while preserving all functionality

### Memory Management Enhancements
- **GPU Memory Optimization**: Sophisticated memory tracking and automatic resource management
- **Model Loading Strategy**: On-demand model loading and unloading after use
- **Memory Optimization Strategies**: Multiple optimization approaches based on available VRAM
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of GPU resources to prevent memory leaks
- **Enhanced Hardware Manager**: Improved GPU detection and memory allocation

### LangGraph Integration
- **Pipeline Architecture**: Enhanced base LangGraph pipeline for complex workflows
- **State Management**: Improved state handling for multi-step reasoning tasks
- **Node Coordination**: Better coordination between pipeline nodes and execution flows
- **Context Preservation**: Enhanced context passing between LangGraph nodes
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery mechanisms in graph-based pipelines

### Tool Usage & Execution Fixes
- **Dynamic Tool Integration**: Improved dynamic tool loading and execution
- **Tool Security**: Enhanced security validation for dynamic tool execution
- **Error Recovery**: Better error handling and recovery in tool execution pipelines
- **Tool Analysis**: Improved tool similarity matching and recommendation system
- **Integration Stability**: Fixed integration issues between tools and model pipelines

### Architecture Benefits
- **Before**: 3 interconnected files with complex Scrapy/twisted dependencies
- **After**: 1 self-contained class using standard Python libraries
- **Dependencies**: Only requests, BeautifulSoup, and standard libraries
- **Memory Management**: Clean synchronous extraction without Scrapy complexity

## 🛠️ Infrastructure
- Multi-environment Python architecture (evaluation, server, runner)
- Schema-driven development with automatic code generation
- Kubernetes deployment automation
- Comprehensive benchmarking and evaluation suite

## 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Kubernetes cluster for production deployment
- GPU resources for model inference
