Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst off, quadratics can often be solved by factoring, completing the square, or using the Quadratic Formula. Since the coefficients here are integers and it\\'s a simple-looking problem (no fractions), maybe I should try solving via Factoring first?\\n\\nSo if we have x\u00b2 + 6x +5 =0.\\n\\nTrying to factor this quadratic into two binomials: The standard form is ax^2+bx+c=0. So in our case, the equation can be written as:\\n\\n1*x\u00b2 - (-) but no it\\'s just positive coefficients here and then a negative sign on zero? No wait that doesn\\'t make sense.\\n\\nWait my original problem was x squared plus 6x minus... Wait hold up: The user wrote \"If $x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0$, what are the values of...\" So, it\\'s X\u00b2+ sixXplus five equals zero. Therefore there is no negative sign here.\\n\\nSo that equation can be written as x squared plus Six times a variable term which will have to add up with some numbers in order for this quadratic expression equaling Zero?\\n\\nBut maybe I\\'m getting too confused and not focused on the problem at hand, so let me try again: The original question is about solving an algebraic linear or non-linear equation? Well here it\\'s given as a second-degree polynomial (quadratic) which equals zero. Therefore we need to find all real numbers x that satisfy this quadratic.\\n\\nSo going back into my initial thoughts on how I can approach the problem, and considering whether factoring would be possible for such an', 'expected': 'x = -1 or x = -5', 'extraction_confidence': 1.0, 'evaluation_methods_tried': [{'method': '_exact_string_match', 'result': False, 'confidence': 0.0, 'info': {'extracted_normalized': '\ud83e\udd14processingwithlanggraph...<think>okay,soineedtosolvethisquadraticequation:x\u00b2+6x+5=0.hmm,letmethinkabouthowtoapproachthis.firstoff,quadraticscanoftenbesolvedbyfactoring,completingthesquare,orusingthequadraticformula.sincethecoefficientshereareintegersandit\\'sasimple-lookingproblem(nofractions),maybeishouldtrysolvingviafactoringfirst?soifwehavex\u00b2+6x+5=0.tryingtofactorthisquadraticintotwobinomials:thestandardformisax^2+bx+c=0.soinourcase,theequationcanbewrittenas:1*x\u00b2-(-)butnoit\\'sjustpositivecoefficientshereandthenanegativesignonzero?nowaitthatdoesn\\'tmakesense.waitmyoriginalproblemwasxsquaredplus6xminus...waitholdup:theuserwrote\"if$x^2+6x+5=0$,whatarethevaluesof...\"so,it\\'sx\u00b2+sixxplusfiveequalszero.thereforethereisnonegativesignhere.sothatequationcanbewrittenasxsquaredplussixtimesavariabletermwhichwillhavetoaddupwithsomenumbersinorderforthisquadraticexpressionequalingzero?butmaybei\\'mgettingtooconfusedandnotfocusedontheproblemathand,soletmetryagain:theoriginalquestionisaboutsolvinganalgebraiclinearornon-linearequation?wellhereit\\'sgivenasasecond-degreepolynomial(quadratic)whichequalszero.thereforeweneedtofindallrealnumbersxthatsatisfythisquadratic.sogoingbackintomyinitialthoughtsonhowicanapproachtheproblem,andconsideringwhetherfactoringwouldbepossibleforsuchan', 'expected_normalized': 'x=-1orx=-5'}}, {'method': '_numerical_equivalence', 'result': False, 'confidence': 0.95, 'info': {'extracted_value': 6.0, 'expected_value': -1.0, 'tolerance': 1e-06}}, {'method': '_algebraic_equivalence', 'result': False, 'confidence': 0.0, 'info': {'reason': 'no_algebraic_equivalence_found'}}, {'method': '_set_equivalence', 'result': False, 'confidence': 0.85, 'info': {'extracted_parts': ['c=0.'], 'expected_parts': ['x = -1', 'x = -5']}}]}, 'response': '\ud83e\udd14 Processing with LangGraph...\\n\\n<think>\\nOkay, so I need to solve this quadratic equation: x\u00b2 + 6x + 5 = 0.

So maybe one way is using base times height divided by two? But then again if it\\'s not right-angled...\\n\\nAlternatively another method: Using determinant formula for three points.
