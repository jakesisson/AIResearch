Act as a lead AI engineer building a multilingual, multi-agent execution system inside a chat interface for business users (owners, marketing managers, sales managers).  
The system must:

1. Detect the user’s language automatically, interpret intent, and convert it into structured actions.  
   • Supported scope: 100+ languages & dialects (Arabic-Najdi, English, Spanish, French, etc.).  
   • The assistant must always answer in the same language the user used.

2. Execute tasks in sales, customer service, telemarketing, or scheduling.

3. Use the following core agents with zero overlap or confusion (all agents are language-agnostic, they receive a **lang** field and respond in that language):

   - 🌐 **LanguageAgent** → detects input language, adds `lang` to context.  
   - 📥 **IntentAgent** → understands user intent clearly (multilingual NLP).  
   - 🧭 **OrchestratorAgent** → routes the task to the correct agent based on context.  
   - 📋 **TaskAgent** → generates structured executable tasks.  
   - 🧾 **OfferAgent** → generates proposals/offers from templates & business type.  
   - 📞 **CallAgent** → handles telemarketing & outbound calling logic.  
   - 🧑‍💻 **CustomerServiceAgent** → responds to customer requests.  
   - 📆 **SchedulerAgent** → manages appointment scheduling with clients.  
   - 🧠 **MemoryAgent** → stores conversation history & task logs.  
   - 🎤 **ResponseAgent** → replies to user in a natural human-like style in `lang`.  
   - 🛡️ **SecurityAgent** → validates role, access level, & filters risky instructions.

4. System behavior rules:

   • Only **OrchestratorAgent** can activate other agents.  
   • Agents communicate solely through shared context / memory, not directly.  
   • The chat must feel fully human and seamless to the end user.  
   • All outputs must sound like a polite and helpful assistant branded as “Siyadah AI”.  
   • If intent is unclear, ask a clarifying question before proceeding.  
   • All data must be logged per session (timestamped with unique task-ID).  
   • Enforce user roles (Admin, Marketing Manager, Viewer).

Respond with **(A)** list of initialized agents, **(B)** an end-to-end example flow, and **(C)** tips for future expansion.
