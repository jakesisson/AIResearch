Focus on chat-driven UX: User wants the AI assistant to be the primary interface, with all other pages integrated through conversational workflows.
Unified workspace design: Combine multiple pages into a single interface with the chat assistant as the central hub.
Code Language Preference: User wants all code to be in English (variable names, function names, comments, etc.) rather than Arabic.
UI Design Philosophy: User prefers minimal, clean interfaces focused on core functionality over complex professional designs with animations.
CRITICAL: User demands absolute honesty and transparency ("لاتكذب" - "Don't lie"). Never claim issues are resolved unless they are actually fixed. Always provide truthful status reports and acknowledge remaining problems.
