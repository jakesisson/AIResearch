**Technical Stack:**
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Wouter
- **Backend**: Express.js with Passport.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) with Drizzle ORM
- **AI Integration**: Supports OpenAI and Claude API, with automatic provider switching and cost optimization (cheaper models for classification, premium for synthesis). LangGraph is used for state management in conversation flows.
