Convert the following LinkedIn data to a JSON Resume (https://jsonresume.org/schema):

- For the "skills" section, group skills by typology using the "name" field for the group (e.g., "Soft Skills", "Management Skills", "Technical Skills") and list the actual skills in the "keywords" array for each group. List soft and management skills first, then technical skills.
- Always include the "languages" section in the output, listing each language and the proficiency level if available.
- For each work entry, synthesize and summarize verbose content. Provide a brief, clear description (2-3 sentences max) and then a few highlights as bullet points. Avoid copying long text verbatim from LinkedIn.
- If a skill or language could fit in more than one category, use your best judgment.
