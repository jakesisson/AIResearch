# Common Pest and Disease Management for Kerala Crops

This guide covers common pests and diseases affecting major crops in Kerala and suggests integrated management strategies.

## 1. Coconut (Cocos nucifera)

**Pest/Disease: Rhinoceros Beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros)**
- **Symptoms:** Boreholes in the crown, V-shaped cuts on fronds, drooping leaves.
- **Organic Control:**
  - Filling the topmost leaf axils with a mixture of sand and neem cake (250g) to prevent egg-laying.
  - Setting up pheromone traps (1 per 2 hectares) to attract and kill adult beetles.
  - Releasing the green muscardine fungus (Metarhizium anisopliae) in breeding sites like manure pits.
- **Chemical Control:**
  - In severe cases, apply Sevidol 8G (25g) mixed with 200g of sand in the leaf axils.
  - Leaf axil filling with naphthalene balls (3-4 balls) covered with sand.

**Pest/Disease: Red Palm Weevil (Rhynchophorus ferrugineus)**
- **Symptoms:** Withering of the central shoot, yellowing of inner whorl of leaves, presence of tunnels and a fermented smell from boreholes.
- **Organic Control:**
  - Early detection is key. Use pheromone traps to monitor weevil populations.
  - Avoid causing mechanical injuries to the palm trunk, as these attract weevils.
- **Chemical Control:**
  - Stem injection with Carbaryl (20g in 20ml water) or Imidacloprid (1ml in 10ml water).
  - Infested trees that are beyond recovery should be cut and burned to prevent spread.

**Pest/Disease: Bud Rot (Caused by Phytophthora palmivora fungus)**
- **Symptoms:** The central spindle of leaves turns pale and starts to rot. The entire crown may fall off, killing the tree.
- **Organic Control:**
  - Prophylactic spraying with 1% Bordeaux mixture on the crown before the onset of monsoon.
- **Chemical Control:**
  - Remove and burn all affected tissues. Apply Bordeaux paste and protect from rain.
  - Drench the crown with Copper Oxychloride 0.25%.

## 2. Rice (Oryza sativa)

**Pest/Disease: Brown Plant Hopper (BPH) (Nilaparvata lugens)**
- **Symptoms:** "Hopperburn" - circular yellow patches that dry up and turn brown. Tiny brown or black insects at the base of the stem.
- **Organic Control:**
  - Maintain a proper water level; intermittent draining can disrupt the hopper's lifecycle.
  - Encourage natural predators like spiders and dragonflies by minimizing pesticide use.
  - Plant resistant varieties like Jyothi and Uma.
- **Chemical Control:**
  - Apply Imidacloprid 17.8% SL at 1 ml/litre of water or Thiamethoxam 25% WG at 1g/litre, focusing on the base of the plants.

**Pest/Disease: Bacterial Leaf Blight (BLB) (Xanthomonas oryzae)**
- **Symptoms:** Yellowish, wavy lesions along the leaf margins, starting from the tips. In severe cases, leaves wither and die.
- **Organic Control:**
  - Use balanced fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen application.
  - Ensure good drainage and sanitation in the field.
- **Chemical Control:**
  - Spray Streptocycline (1g in 10 litres of water) along with Copper Oxychloride (2g/litre).

## 3. Brinjal (Solanum melongena)

**Pest/Disease: Fruit and Shoot Borer (Leucinodes orbonalis)**
- **Symptoms:** Drooping and dead shoots, holes in fruits plugged with excreta.
- **Organic Control:**
  - Remove and destroy affected shoots and fruits immediately.
  - Use pheromone traps to monitor and trap male moths.
  - Spray neem oil (3%) or Beauveria bassiana.
- **Chemical Control:**
  - Spray Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG (0.4 g/litre) or Spinosad 45% SC (0.3 ml/litre).
