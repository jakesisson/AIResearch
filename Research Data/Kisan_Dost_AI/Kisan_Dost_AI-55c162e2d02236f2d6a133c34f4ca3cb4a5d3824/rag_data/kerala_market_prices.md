**Report Date:** September 15, 2025
**Source:** Kerala State Agricultural Market Intelligence Unit (Fictional)

This report provides an analysis of key agricultural commodity prices and market trends observed in the third quarter of 2025 across major markets in Kerala.

## Key Highlights

1.  **Coconut & Copra:** Prices have remained stable but are expected to rise in the coming months due to increased festive demand for Onam and Diwali. Mill-grade copra is trading higher than edible-grade in some northern districts due to industrial demand.
2.  **Nendran Banana:** A significant price surge was observed in August due to high demand for the Onam festival season. Prices are expected to correct downwards by late September but remain profitable. Farmers with a ready-to-harvest crop in early August saw maximum profits.
3.  **Rubber:** Rubber sheet (RSS-4) prices have shown a slight upward trend, influenced by international market movements and a temporary supply shortage caused by heavy monsoon rains disrupting tapping activities.
4.  **Cardamom:** Prices in the Idukki auction centers have been volatile. A recent pest outbreak of 'Azhukal' disease has slightly impacted the quality of arrivals, leading to price fluctuations. High-quality, 8mm bold capsules are fetching a premium.
5.  **Vegetables:** Prices for locally grown vegetables like bitter gourd, okra, and brinjal saw a dip in July due to peak season arrivals but recovered strongly in August. Tomato prices from Idukki and Palakkad remain high due to rain-induced crop damage.

## Market Advisory for Farmers

- **Banana Farmers:** Those planning to plant Nendran should target a harvest period just before major festivals to capitalize on peak prices.
- **Coconut Growers:** Avoid immediate selling if holding stock. Prices are likely to improve over the next 4-6 weeks.
- **Vegetable Growers:** Consider staggered planting for a continuous supply to hedge against price volatility. There is a strong market for organically grown vegetables, which can fetch a 20-30% premium.
- **Cardamom Planters:** Focus on post-harvest processing to ensure high-quality capsules, as the market is paying a significant premium for quality.
